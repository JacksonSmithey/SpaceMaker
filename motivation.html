    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
        The notion of a mathematical space is not well defined. 
        If you're looking for a workable mathematical definition, then you've come to the wrong planet.
        Here, the closest thing we have to a definition of space is "a set A with some kind of structure."
        The structure part is vague, but that is exactly the power of interpreting spaces in this way.
        There is no set method for making a new structure. If a brilliant mathematician decides to do
        things in a new way that only works in a space with a new set of rules, then they've created a new space.

        For example, Euclid created a space called the Euclidean plane.
        Descartes (2000 years later) took this plane and added coordinates which are useful for algebra.
        Even though Descartes started with a pre-existing space, since he added additional structure to it
        -- the result is a new space called the Cartesian plane that is fundamentally diffent from the Euclidean plane.
        
        You may be thinking... "Mathematicians must have created millions of spaces by now! Are there are any left
        to discover?"
        The truth is, modern mathematics only has about 10 major fundamental kinds of spaces.
        There are few enough that one man could theoretically list them all on one website.


    </p>    
    <p> 
        Most people never learn about spaces because math courses don't often address which one you're working in.
        If you're applying mathematics to known problems, the problem solving methods you learn
        will already abide by the spatial structure it was discovered in.
        This approach makes it easy for students to work within a space, but avoids conceptualizing 
        space as a fundamental mathematical object that can also be manipulated.
        Consequently the concept of space remains ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p> 
        This application intends to do the opposite. 
        Provide examples of spaces, show what makes them important/unique, then provide examples working with them.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Contrary to most mathematical ideas, space has <u>no formal definition</u>. The closest thing you'll 
        find might be something like "a set with a structure." So let's get started by developing some intuition.
