    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
        A mathematical space is a set of objects equipped with some kind of structure that defines
        the interactions between its objects. 
        <br>I know, super vague right? But sometimes vagueness is extremely powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, to model real life as a mathematical space, the set could be {Matter, Antimatter, Photons, ...}
        and the structure could be a list of the laws of physics.
        Let's say there was a DVD copy of this real-life space found deep in the pyramids of Giza.

        <br>That DVD would be the most valuable item ever. it would contain every bit of information 
        in the universe and every law of physics.
        <br>With it, mathematicians could simulate a perfectly accurate model of real life allowing us  
        to exactly predict the future and perfectly replay the past. 
        <br>Even better; With a sufficiently powerful VR setup, we could insert people into simulations
        of anywhere and anytime in the universe.
        <br>Again, this isn't even close to possible. As you will see, the current study of mathematical
        spaces is unmeasurable compared to the real-life space. 
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        For the spaces we <i>have</i> created, there is no set method for making a new structure. 
        <br>If a brilliant mathematician decides to manipulate objects with a new set of rules, 
        then they've discovered a new space.
        <br>A quick historical example: Euclid created a space called the Euclidean plane.
        <br>2000 years later, Descartes took the Euclidean plane and added a coordinate structure.
        Even though Descartes started with a pre-existing space -- the result was a new space called the Cartesian plane.
        It's important that new spaces are fundamentally diffent from their predecessors.
        <br>If there's a turn left(TL) space and a turn right(TR) space, then we have this structure-preserving map
        called 'upside down' that can change between them without violating either of the spaces structures.
        When this happens, we can say that the TL space and the TR space are actually the same thing.
        <br>This wasn't the case with Euclid and Descartes because the only way to transpose them is by
        adding or subtracting the coordinate structure. Thus any maps between the two are 
        not structure-preserving.
        
        <br>There aren't that many spaces out there either. The truth is, modern mathematics only 
        has about 10 major fundamental kinds of spaces.
        <br>There are few enough that one extremely caffeinated man could theoretically list them all 
        on one website.
    </p>    
    <p> 
        What do you think the first mathematical space humanity discovered was?
        <br>What sets were they thinking of and what rules/structures were they using.
    </p>

      Enough jabbering, Let's start with a familiar space to match our intuition with the abstract.
